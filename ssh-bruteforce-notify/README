ssh_bruteforce_notify.pl

WARNING: this tool is abusive. If your machine was bruteforced 1000 times from the same IP, the abuse contact WILL GET 
1000 EMAILS.
To mitigate, you can use pf tarpit to block source IP if it connects too many times to SSH port:
/etc/pf.conf:
table <tarpit> persist
pass in quick on $ext inet proto tcp from any to <finn> port  22  flags S/SA modulate state (max-src-conn-rate 8/60, 
overload <tarpit> flush global)


Parses security emails from FreeBSD periodic(8) to find all SSH bruteforce attempts.
Once found, the script will send out an email to an abuse contact for source IP address - PER BRUTEFORCE ATTEMPT.
The contact is found through whois utility.


To use:
Put following into ~/.procmailrc for the periodic recipient (usually root):
PROCMAILDIR=$HOME/.procmail
INCLUDERC=$PROCMAILDIR/rc.ssh_bruteforce

Put the following into $PROCMAILDIR/rc.ssh_bruteforce
