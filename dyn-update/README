Provides easy way to dynamically change ip for myhost.domain.com from cron (tested on FreeBSD)

Quick howto:
1. Generate the keypair:
dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-SHA512 -b 512 -n HOST myhost.domain.com 

2. Configure BIND named.conf on the DNS server:
Look at the either of the genrated files (.private and .key), you will see a random string of characters, this is your secret.

Add this key to your named.conf:
key myhost.domain.com. {
    algorithm hmac-md5;
    secret "secret";
};

Edit zone stanza in your named.conf for this domain so it looks like this:
zone "domain.com" {
    type master;
    file "master/db.domain.com";
    allow-update { key myhost.domain.com; };
};

NOTE: after you do this, you CANNOT edit db.domain.com zone by hand anymore - nsupdate creates a db.domain.com.jnl 
file which contains the journal of changes and is maintaied automatically.

3. Add following to crontab on the dynamic host:
0       *       *       *       *       cd /path/to/nsupdate && sh nsupdate.sh
